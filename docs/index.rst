=============================================================================

DroneDB provides a standard command line application (``ddb``) for managing aerial data. With it you can extract and manipulate information from various types of aerial data (currently aerial images, orthophotos and DSM/DTM, but other data types coming soon).

DroneDB can create an index for your data and sync it to a network server (work in progress) for highly scalable and flexible data management and sharing across an organization, the internet or for your own personal data-organizing enjoyment.

It's also available as a library (``libddb`` for developers), for which Node.JS bindings exist (.NET and Python bindings coming soon).

We're also working toward an awesome cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI). `Sign up for updates <https://uav4geo.com/software/dronedb>`_.

*DroneDB is in early development stages and is targeted at GIS geeks and early adopters. Try it out!*
